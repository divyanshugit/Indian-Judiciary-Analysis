## About Data:
For analysis of the Indian Judicial Data, we will utilize the dataset provided Development Data Lab(DDL) Judicial Data. You can find the dataset and details [here](https://www.devdatalab.org/judicial-data). The open-source data contains data from 2010 to 2018. We will take data collected after 2016 into consideration for the majority of our analysis. DDL also released a [manuscript](https://shrug-assets-ddl.s3.amazonaws.com/static/main/assets/other/India_Courts_In_Group_Bias.pdf) where they examined the group bias in the Indian Judiciary System. A few sections of the analysis of data are inspired by the paper.
